Evaluation Summary:

- The `Vector` class works correctly for basic operations such as adding elements (`push_back`) and accessing elements (`operator[]`).
- The `resize` function in `Vector` works as expected when the vector exceeds its initial capacity.
- The `DataProcessor` class successfully loads data from a CSV file and calculates wind statistics (average, standard deviation) and solar radiation for specific months.
- The `Date` and `Time` classes properly encapsulate date and time data, and all getter and setter methods function correctly.
- All test cases in `VectorTest.cpp`, `DateTest.cpp`, and `TimeTest.cpp` pass successfully for normal input.
- Edge cases related to empty data files and invalid dates (like February 30) are handled correctly.
- No major issues were found in the implementation.

Outstanding Issues:
- The test case for handling incorrect file formats (non-CSV) is not fully implemented and may cause the program to crash.
- There is no error handling for extreme edge cases such as missing required columns in the CSV file.
- The DataProcessor class has not been tested
